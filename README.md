Hey,

Here you'll find several Event/Actions and Standalone Programs that I have created for IBM Filenet, Case Manager and ICN. I have worked on JAVA to implement the desired result. (This was my work during my internship period).

I will always try to keep this README as updated and informative as possible, And if you think I am missing something please comment...

Codes added :

				1. Rename On Checkin --Uploaded --Working
						{
							An Event Action in IBM Case Manager that Renames Uploaded Document to "<document><date&time>" format.
							One of the most basic event action.
						}
				2. Standalone Java Application that Exports all the case document form Object Store and arrange it in specified format.
						{
						
							<case TYpe>/<case Number>/<Document Class>/<Document>
						
						}
